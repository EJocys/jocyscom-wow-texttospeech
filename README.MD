<hr />

<p align="justify">Latest version can read <i>quests</i> and <i>chat messages</i>. If your game supports addons and you know, how to write one, you can add text-to-speech feature to your game too. How it works: When you open NPC dialogue window or receive/send chat message in game, <b>“WoW Addon”</b> creates and sends to you whisper (chat) message between  <code>&lt;voice&gt;&lt;part&gt;text&lt;/part&gt;&lt;/voice&gt;</code> tags. This message can include main <code>text</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>gender</code>, <code>pitch</code>, <code>rate</code>, <code>effect</code>, <code>volume</code>, ... and <code>command</code> value. Then, <b>“Monitor”</b>, which must be running in background, while gaming, picks-up this message from your network traffic and reads it with specific text-to-speech voice. FREE text-to-speech voices can be installed (on Windows 8.#) with various Microsoft language packs. BETTER text-to-speech voices can be downloaded and installed from <a href="http://www.ivona.com/us/for-individuals/voices-for-windows/">Ivona.com</a> / <a href="http://harposoftware.com/en/content/10-trial">Harposoftware.com</a>&nbsp;(distributor) websites.

### Security and concerns
<hr />

<p align="justify">This “WoW Addon” and “Monitor” does not give you more power or advantages over NPCs or other players in game. It does not send data back to game or anywhere else. It only reads local network messages between <code>&lt;voice&gt;</code> tags or all text from your clipboard with installed text-to-speech voices to you, when you choose so. It makes game more involving, fun and interesting. It makes things easier for people with dyslexia too. This project is open source... anyone can check all code at any time. We digitally sign our software and put our real names on it, so everyone could know, who to blame, if something will go wrong. It is not in our interest to ruin our reputation with hacks, exploits, spyware, malware or information stealing. Please download this “WoW Addon” and “Monitor” only from trustworthy sources. Make sure that “Monitor” is always <i>signed</i> by verified publisher with signature, issued by trusted certificate authority.</p>
